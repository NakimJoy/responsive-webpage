        Paris, the capital of France, is a city that captivates visitors with its rich history, culture, and
        charm. Paris is often called the City of Love. Its charming streets, cozy cafes, and great sights make it
        an ideal destination for couples. Whether you’re strolling along the Seine River or enjoying a candlelit
        dinner, romance is in the air. I'd like to wander the medieval streets of the Marais, relax on a Paris
        “beach,” explore the famous Les Puces flea market, or enjoy a concert in a magnificent Paris church. Of
        course also take a cooking class, immerse myself in digital art shows at Atelier des Lumieres, and marvel
        at cherry trees in bloom during spring.

      <h2 class="col-12">A Foreign language I'd like to learn</h2>
      <p class="col-12">
        Oddly, I find spanish to be quiet an intriguing language. Being able to travel knowing that you can get
        yourself around and handle pretty much any scenario is one of the biggest reasons to learn Spanish. One
        interesting fact about Spanish is 7.9% of internet users communicate in Spanish, making it the second most
        commonly used language on digital platforms. Only one Spanish-speaking country—Mexico—is among the 10
        countries with the greatest number of internet users.
        You can even travel alone, without having to rely on tour guides or other tourists. It takes away the
        stress and uncertainty that sometimes comes with travel. Spanish makes it feel like and everything is just
        so alright.

    <h2 style="background-color: burlywood;">My three favourite subjects</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-4">
        <h3>Economics</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <p class="col-6-sm font-light" style="font-size: smaller;">The first subject I enjoyed taking in my undergrad
            was economics. I've always
            loved to analyse data and bring
            meaning to graphs, this made me see the world around me in a unique way.

        <h3>Commercial law</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <p class="col-6-sm font-light mid-text" style="font-size: smaller;">Secondly, I'd say Commercial law took most
            of my study breaks. It was
            just understandable, although i think
            the
            lectuere just made it so enjoyable, I really enjoyed learning the legal side of things- I never saw the
            need,
            but this subject made me thing of starting my own business with so much confidence.

        <h3>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <p class="col-6-sm font-light" style="font-size: smaller;">Lastly, my favourite subject would have to be
            cost-benefit analysis, although i
            did this one later on, it
            brought back a lot of hope into data analytics and deceision making to an aspiring economist.

            The house is a single-story red-brick
            matchbox built in 1945.
            It has bullet holes in the walls and the facade has scorch marks from attacks with Molotov cocktails.
            The house was petrol bombed several times and often raided by members of the police force during the
            apartheid.
            Next to the house lies the Morris Isaacson High School where the June 1976 uprisings began.
            The house was commissioned as part of a Johannesburg City tender for new houses in Orlando.
