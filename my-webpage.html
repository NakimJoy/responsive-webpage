      Paris, the capital of France, is a city that captivates visitors with its rich history, culture, and
      charm. Paris is often called the City of Love. Its charming streets, cozy cafes, and great sights make it
      an ideal destination for couples. Whether you’re strolling along the Seine River or enjoying a candlelit
      dinner, romance is in the air. I'd like to wander the medieval streets of the Marais, relax on a Paris
      “beach,” explore the famous Les Puces flea market, or enjoy a concert in a magnificent Paris church. Of
      course also take a cooking class, immerse myself in digital art shows at Atelier des Lumieres, and marvel
      at cherry trees in bloom during spring.

    <h1>A Foreign language</h1>
    <p>Oddly, I find spanish to be quiet an intriguing language. Being able to travel knowing that you can get
      yourself around and handle pretty much any scenario is one of the biggest reasons to learn Spanish. One
      interesting fact about Spanish is 7.9% of internet users communicate in Spanish, making it the second most
      commonly used language on digital platforms. Only one Spanish-speaking country—Mexico—is among the 10
      countries with the greatest number of internet users.
      You can even travel alone, without having to rely on tour guides or other tourists. It takes away the
      stress and uncertainty that sometimes comes with travel. Spanish makes it feel like and everything is just
      so alright.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-4">
<u><h3>Economics</h3></u>
<div class="row">
  <p class="col-6-sm font-light">The first subject I enjoyed taking in my undergrad
          was economics. I've always
          loved to analyse data and bring
          meaning to graphs, this made me see the world around me in a unique way.

      <u><h3>Commercial law</h3></u>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-6-sm font-light" style="font-size: normal; mid-text">Secondly, I'd say Commercial law took most
          of my study breaks. It was
          just understandable, although i think
          the
          lectuere just made it so enjoyable, I really enjoyed learning the legal side of things- I never saw the
          need,
          but this subject made me thing of starting my own business with so much confidence.

    <div class="col-4">
<u><h3>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3></u>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-6-sm font-light">Lastly, my favourite subject would have to be
          cost-benefit analysis, although i
          did this one later on, it
          brought back a lot of hope into data analytics and deceision making to an aspiring economist.

          <p class="col-6-sm font-light">The Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg, South Africa, stands as a powerful
            testament
            to the country's
            tumultuous history and the struggle for equality and justice. Through immersive exhibits, artifacts, and
            multimedia displays, the museum vividly chronicles the apartheid era, offering visitors a comprehensive
            understanding of the system of institutionalized racial segregation and oppression that once defined South
            African society. By confronting the dark chapters of apartheid and honoring the resilience of those who
            fought
            against it.

            The house is a single-story red-brick
            matchbox built in 1945.
            It has bullet holes in the walls and the facade has scorch marks from attacks with Molotov cocktails.
            The house was petrol bombed several times and often raided by members of the police force during the
            apartheid.
            Next to the house lies the Morris Isaacson High School where the June 1976 uprisings began.
            The house was commissioned as part of a Johannesburg City tender for new houses in Orlando.
